This distribution pattern means that there are a small number of very high or very low achieving students in each subject, while most students’ achievement is clustered around the average.\n\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse) \n\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

In reading, women’s average and median scores were slightly higher than men’s. In contrast, when it comes to math scores, men have slightly higher average and median scores than women."

Students who have enough money to get food will get better grades. These students do not need to think about food. Students who ate for lack of money four or five times a week had lower high scores and higher low scores. These students usually did not have bad grades, but they were also hard to have good grades, indicating that Socioeconomic has a strong influence on performances of Math,Reading and Science."
