The number of people with PV scores of about 600 in science is small, and it can be analyzed that it is more difficult to get a high score in science. Reading will be easier for students.</a></li>

Students who have enough money to get food will get better grades. These students do not need to think about food. Students who ate for lack of money four or five times a week had lower high scores and higher low scores. These students usually did not have bad grades, but they were also hard to have good grades, indicating that <strong><em>Socioeconomic</em></strong> has a strong influence on <strong><em>performances of Math,Reading and Science</em></strong>.</a></li>

The number of people with PV scores of about 600 in science is small, and it can be analyzed that it is more difficult to get a high score in science. Reading will be easier for students.</h3>

In reading, it is clear that women’s ability is higher than men’s ability, and women have higher scores and a higher lower limit (minimum score). In math and science, the gender gap is small, with boys getting higher scores, but the difference in scores is small.</h3>
